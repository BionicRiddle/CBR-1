1 x Arduino Nano
1 x TB6612FNG
1 x MPU6050
1 x CBR-1 3D-printed chassi
2 x Yellow 6V DC motors (with wheels)
1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (between 9V battery and PCB)
1 x 4xAA batteryholder
1 x 9V batteryholder
4 x M3x10 screw (M3x12 might also work)
4 x M3 nut

Optional:

1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (now between 4xAA batteryholder and PCB)
2 x LED
2 x Resistors R1 and R2 (whatever resistance you prefer for LEDs, but around 300 ohm works fine. "100 Ohm" on the PCB is referring the bold)
