Beginner balancing robot developed by CASE Association.

# Bill of materials
  - 1 x Arduino Nano
  - 1 x TB6612FNG (DC motor driver)
  - 1 x MPU6050 (Inertial measurement unit)
  - 1 x CBR-1 3D-printed chassi
  - 2 x 6V DC motors (with wheels)
  - 1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (between 9V battery and PCB)
  - 1 x 4xAA batteryholder
  - 1 x 9V batteryholder
  - 4 x M3x10 screw (M3x12 might also work)
  - 4 x M3 nut
  - Wires
  - Heatshrink

Optional:

  - 1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (now between the 4xAA batteryholder and PCB)
  - 2 x LED
  - 2 x Resistors R1 and R2
  - Various pin-connectors
For R1 and R2, use whatever resistance you prefer for LEDs in these applications, but around 300 ohm works fine. We used 100 Ohm for a red LED and 300 Ohm for a blue LED.

All of the components are available to purchase in the iZettle, but feel free to use your own components if you for instance want a more powerful battery to power the motors. The most important thing is that you are able to supply 9-12 V to the Arduino and at least 6 V to the motors (a somewhat higher voltage will work, you'll get more power!). Using 4xAA (4 in series) is the absolute minimum battery solution, considering the max current you get from them.


The 3D-printed chassi can, if not bought through iZettle, be redesigned and 3D-printed if you like. The STL file is provided in the CAD folder, and you can also design things to add to the robot! The picture below shows an example of a way to increase the distance between the ground and the centrum of mass by placing the batteries on top. This makes it easier for the robot to balance!

The STL file for this extra piece can also be found in the CAD folder.

# Soldering
There's quite a bit of it.

## Soldering components to the PCB

![top](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CASE-Association/CBR-1/main/Pictures/IMG_20210429_180747__01.jpg)

The three main components to solder to the PCB are:

  - Arduino Nano
  - TB6612FNG
  - MPU6050

The PCB is marked where to attach each component, but you can solder in two ways:

### Directly to the PCB
This gives the most clean look, but can be quite troublesome if something goes wrong. It's very important that you orient the components in the correct way (they fit both ways, but only one works)! Double check that the ports on the components match the ones on the PCB before soldering.

### With female pin connectors to the PCB
Solder female pin connectors to the PCB and then attach your components to them. This way you can reuse components if you don't feel like buying the same component for another project in the future. If a component fails, you can also replace them much easier.

Connectors can be soldered to the ports for 6-12 V, powersupply (marked "PSU" or "6V"), motor A and motor B if you like. This makes it easier to detach parts of the robot without needing to desolder anything. In the example on page 1, 90Â° male pin connectors are used on the PCB while the motors and batteries all have female pin connectors soldered to their respective cables.

When soldering wires to the batterypacks, don't forget to use red for positive and black for negative! Things get very problematic if they are mixed up!

## Wiring

### Motors
For each motor, solder wires to each of the connections on the motor. Heatshrink is good to use here (don't for get to put it on before you solder!), and applying some hot glue around the connection after everything is done will decrease the risk of the copper breaking from bending. Also, using dupont cables with female pin connectors is a fast way to get wires without having to attach connectors to the end of the wires. Just cut one end off and keep the other!

### Batterypacks
If you only want to use one switch, use it with the 9V battery. This ensures that the only switch used is turning the Arduino Nano on/off (since the 9-12V port is powering the Nano and PSU/6V is powering the motors).
The switch can be between the battery and the positive or the negative pin on the PSU/6V ports, since it's breaking the circuit. We soldered a wire from the positive pole of the batteryholder to the switch, and then another wire (dupont-cable with one end cut off) on the other pin on the switch. Another dupont cable was soldered to the negative pole on the battery holder.

Repeat this for the other pack, but ignore the switch if you do not want to use two of them. But remember, having control over both batterypacks while the robot is in action is very helpful. We recommend two switches!
# Assembly

## Gluing

Bring out the glue gun! Everything except for the PCB is attached with hot glue, so just glue on the motors and batterypacks!
