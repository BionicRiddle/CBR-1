Beginner balancing robot developed by CASE Association.

# Bill of materials
  - 1 x Arduino Nano
  - 1 x TB6612FNG (DC motor driver)
  - 1 x MPU6050 (Inertial measurement unit)
  - 1 x CBR-1 3D-printed chassi
  - 2 x 6V DC motors (with wheels)
  - 1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (between 9V battery and PCB)
  - 1 x 4xAA batteryholder
  - 1 x 9V batteryholder
  - 4 x M3x10 screw (M3x12 might also work)
  - 4 x M3 nut

Optional:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1 x Rockerswitch or other switch (now between the 4xAA batteryholder and PCB)
\item 2 x LED
\item 2 x Resistors R1 and R2
\item Various pin-connectors
\end{itemize}
For R1 and R2, use whatever resistance you prefer for LEDs in these applications, but around 300 ohm works fine. We used 100 Ohm for a red LED and 300 Ohm for a blue LED.
